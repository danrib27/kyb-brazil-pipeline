# kybr-pipeline

**Supplier risk scoring lakehouse built on Brazilian public data.**

kybr-pipeline is a Know-Your-Business (KYB) pipeline: is an end-to-end data
platform that cross-references Brazil's federal company registry, public
procurement records and government sanction lists to flag high-risk government
suppliers.

## What it answers

- Is a company that just won a public contract currently sanctioned?
- Does it share partners with other suppliers of the same government agency?
- Was it incorporated only a few months before winning a high-value tender?
